My competitive programming work

## Structrue
- **`codeforces/`**: Codeforces work
- **`kattis/`**: A (non-complete) set of problems solved as a part of CS311 - CPII at Purdue University.

## Makefile
### auto ignore executables
I don't like `.exe` extensions

- `generate_gitignore.sh`:
    Run this in any director to find executeable files and add them to `.gitignore`.
    - Use `make gitignore` in any directory with a makefile to trigger.

### Easy Compilation
- `make` and `make all` work as expected, compiling all C++ files in the directory.
